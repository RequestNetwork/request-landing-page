<h2>What about these Terms & Conditions?</h2>

<p>These Terms & Conditions (hereinafter the “T&Cs” or “Terms and Conditions”) govern your access to and use of the Protocol, the Request Network API, and related services (hereinafter the “Services”) provided by the Request Network. The Services include, but are not limited to: (a) access to and use of the Request Network API for creating, tracking, or managing payment requests on-chain; (b) related documentation, developer tools, SDKs, and webhooks; (c) integrations enabling payment tracking, off-ramping, cross-chain routing, or third-party routing; and (d) any enhancements or additional services provided by Request Network now or in the future.</p>

<p>By using our Services, you agree that you have read, understood and accepted all of the T&Cs, the Cookie Policy (<a href="https://request.network/cookiepolicy">https://request.network/cookiepolicy</a>) and the Privacy Policy (<a href="https://request.network/privacypolicy">https://request.network/privacypolicy</a>) incorporated herein by reference and amended from time to time. You must not use the Services if you don’t agree with those terms. You are responsible for ensuring that all persons who access or use the Services through your device, company account, or internet connection are aware of those documents and that they comply with them.</p>

<p>Request Network reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these T&Cs at any time. In such cases, Request Network will appropriately inform you of these changes. Such changes will only affect our relationship in the future. The continued use of the Services signifies your acceptance of the revised T&Cs. You can obtain previous versions at first demand. If you do not accept the new T&Cs, you must stop using our Services and terminate your account immediately.</p>

<h2>How to access and use our Services?</h2>

<h3>Account registration and termination</h3>

<p>To access the full functionality of our Services, including integration with the Request Network API, you must create a user or developer account by providing the required information and keeping it up to date. Failure to maintain accurate and current details may result in limited access or service interruptions. If you forget your password, you can reset it using the "Forgot your password?" option by entering your registered email address. You will receive instructions for setting a new password.</p>

<p>Your account may grant access to multiple services and environments provided by Request Network and its affiliated modules. We reserve the right to extend or limit such access depending on compliance, technical compatibility, or integration requirements.</p>

<p>If you are a minor or a legally protected person, you represent that you have obtained authorization from a parent, guardian or legal supervisor, who agrees to ensure your compliance with these T&Cs.</p>

<p>You may terminate your account and stop using our Services at any time, unless we or our integration partners suspect that the termination is intended to avoid compliance review or investigative actions. To request account closure, contact us at support.api@request.network.</p>

<p>Please note that Request Network does not charge recurring fees or operate under a subscription model. Any usage-based fees or charges (such as per-request processing costs on-chain) will be communicated transparently at the time of execution and are non-refundable once a request is finalized or confirmed on the blockchain.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality and use of the account</h3>

<p>You are responsible for securing your login credentials, API keys and access tokens. We recommend using strong, unique passwords and restricting credential access to authorized personnel only. You must store API keys in a secure environment and avoid exposing them in public code repositories or unsecured channels.</p>

<p>Request Network shall not be held liable for any unauthorized use, compromise or mismanagement of your credentials. You remain fully accountable for all actions taken using your access credentials, regardless of whether such actions were authorized by you.</p>

<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Request Network harmless from any claims, losses or damages arising from your failure to maintain appropriate security measures.</p>

<p>If you suspect that your credentials, account, or technical access information has been compromised or misused, you must immediately notify us at privacy.api@request.network.</p>

<h3>Developer environment and integration requirements</h3>

<p>Using our Services requires a properly configured and secure development environment. This includes having stable internet access, API request capabilities and the ability to manage cryptographic operations. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your technical infrastructure meets the minimum requirements for accessing and using the Request Network API.</p>

<p>You must have an environment capable of sending and receiving HTTPS requests, handling API keys securely and integrating with Ethereum-compatible wallets or signing tools. Inadequate configuration of your environment or the use of unsupported tools may result in the inaccessibility or improper functioning of the Services, without entitling you to any claim or compensation.</p>

<p>All costs related to the setup, maintenance and use of your development environment, whether for hardware, software, network access or technical integration, are exclusively your responsibility. Request Network does not provide support for legacy or insecure systems, nor does it guarantee compatibility with all programming frameworks, operating systems, or third-party dependencies.</p>

<p>Our Services are designed for backend systems and developer-controlled environments. Therefore, you must ensure your systems and code follow standard security practices to protect against unauthorized access and data exposure. We are not responsible for misconfigurations, insecure deployments, or any failures resulting from your internal development practices.</p>

<h3>Availability of our Services</h3>

<p>Our Services, including access to the Request Network API and related infrastructure, are generally available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, we do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>

<p>Availability may be affected by scheduled maintenance, technical updates, unexpected outages, network congestion, or the availability of third-party services that our infrastructure interacts with, including IPFS nodes, blockchain networks, and off-ramp providers. We reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to the Services at any time and without prior notice if required for maintenance, legal compliance, risk mitigation, or security reasons.</p>

<p>Request Network operates on a best-effort basis and does not offer a service level agreement (hereinafter “SLA”) unless explicitly agreed to in writing between the Parties. No representations or warranties, express or implied, shall be deemed to create any guaranteed level of uptime or responsiveness outside of such written SLA.</p>

<p>We shall not be held liable for delays, downtimes, performance issues, or loss of access resulting from technical limitations, external dependencies, or force majeure events.</p>

<p>You are responsible for monitoring the operational status of the Services relevant to your implementation and for implementing fail-safes or alternative measures within your own infrastructure, where necessary.</p>

<h3>Account suspension and deletion</h3>

<p>Request Network reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or revoke access to any user account, project identifier, or API credentials that are deemed suspicious, abusive, inactive, or in violation of these T&C. Such actions may be taken without prior notice and shall not entitle you to any compensation, damages, or reimbursement.</p>

<p>Access may also be suspended or terminated in cases of suspected security breaches, unauthorized use, excessive request volumes beyond acceptable limits, or use of the Services for illegal, deceptive, or harmful purposes.</p>

<p>In addition, Request Network reserves the right to permanently deactivate any account or API credentials that remain unused (i.e., no valid API requests made) for a continuous period of 12 (twenty) months. You will be notified at the contact address associated with your account at least one month prior to such deactivation.</p>

<p>The suspension or deletion of your access credentials does not affect Request Network’s right to pursue legal remedies or seek compensation for any damages caused by violations of these T&C.</p>

<h3>Use of Services, access conditions and content ownership</h3>

<p>The Services, including but not limited to the Protocol, the Request Network API, SDKs, developer documentation, example code and technical integration materials, are intended for use by developers, integrators and partners seeking to build on or interact with the Request protocol. Unless expressly stated otherwise, all such content is the intellectual property of Request Network or its licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.</p>

<p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use the Services for their intended purpose, in accordance with applicable technical documentation, integration terms and applicable law. You may not reproduce, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from the Services or any part thereof without prior written consent from Request Network.</p>

<p>Request Network undertakes reasonable efforts to ensure that the materials made available through its Services are accurate, compliant with applicable law, and do not infringe third-party rights. However, absolute legal compliance or technical accuracy cannot be guaranteed. If you believe that any content or component of the Services violates applicable laws or infringes your rights, you are encouraged to contact us at support.api@request.network. All such reports will be reviewed in good faith and, where appropriate, necessary action will be taken.</p>

<h3>Our Services</h3>

<p>The Services provide developers and integrators with access to infrastructure that facilitates on-chain payment tracking and web3 financial workflows. These services are accessible through a unified API that interacts with Request protocol smart contracts and integrates third-party providers to enable more advanced routing scenarios such as cross-chain transactions and off-ramp execution.</p>

<p>Request Network does not offer or provide custody, exchange, or transfer of crypto-assets. Instead, it acts as a middleware layer that facilitates interaction with other regulated service providers via its API.</p>

<p>All Services are provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. Request Network does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation, nor does it guarantee any particular result. No advice or information obtained through the Services shall create any warranty unless expressly stated in a written agreement.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>Use of the Request Network API may involve transaction-based or volume-based fees, as communicated transparently at the time of execution of the said transaction. Third-party services accessed through the API may impose additional fees under their own terms, for which Request Network is not responsible.</p>

<p>Request Network reserves the right to update its pricing structure at any time. Changes will be communicated in advance and will only apply prospectively to future use of the Services.</p>
